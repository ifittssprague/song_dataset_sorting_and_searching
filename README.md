# song_dataset_sorting_and_searching

The following is a project I did as part of my advanced data structures course. The project description is as follows. 

In today‚Äôs Internet-dominated world we take for granted the ability of computers to search through vast quantities of data to find information that interests us. The ability of search engines to find data quickly is the result of many programmers‚Äô and algorithm designers‚Äô efforts over a number of years. In this project, you will have the opportunity to join the ranks of this prestigious group by developing your algorithms and codes for a Million Song Dataset.
which will both sort and search through a database of information related to songs. This data, which is a subset of the, provides an example of the mass quantities of data that are evaluated by computers billions of times a day.
In this assignment, you will read in a subset of the Million Song Dataset from an Excel file. It contains information around 10,000 songs which contains several fields such as title, artist, song duration, track ID. Then You will then perform search and sort operations on the data to demonstrate the performance of different sorting and searching algorithms.
Task Overview
In this project, you will perform the following specific tasks.
1. Manage your data in Python classes and objects. For example, you should manage songs in the Song object and song library in SongLibrary.
    a. In the Song class, you should have variables for the different attributes of the songs (title, artist, song duration, track ID).
    b. In the SongLibrary class, you should have basic information about the library which usually contains an array for all the Song objects, an integer that indicates how many songs in the library and a Boolean variable that shows whether the library is sorted or not. In order to make it efficient to search the songs we need, we also need a binary search tree (BST) for the song library based on the song title.
2. Read in the database of songs using the ReadSongArray method in SongLibrary class. The method takes the input data file name and loads the songs in the file to the library. Make sure the order of the songs is the same as the one in the input file.
3. Implement a linear search algorithm to search the songs based on either song title or artist. Return the number of the songs found in the song array that satisfies your search. The
search function should have two parameters, one for your query and one for the attribute
(string as ‚Äòtitle‚Äô or ‚Äòartist‚Äô).
4. Implement a QuickSort algorithm to sort the song database based on the song title. The
sorted songs should be stored in the same song array. Make sure you change the status
of the Boolean variable that shows whether the library is sorted or not.
5. Implement a function to build a balanced BST of the songs based on the song title. Record the time spent on building the BST. Ideally the height of a balanced BST for 10,000 songs
are 14. In this task, you need to build a tree with height AT MOST 24.
6. Implement a search function for song title on BST.
7. Perform a linear search in the sorted database for the 100 songs. You can a random number generator to arbitrarily select 100 song titles. Record the average time spent on the linear search.
8. Perform a search of the same 100 songs in the BST. Record the average time spent.
9. In order to perform a search on BST, we need to spend additional time to build the BST. If we have many songs to search, it is worthwhile for the additional time. Using the information calculated above (Task 5, 7, 8), determine how many linear searches ùíè would be necessary before the overall run time of the linear searches would be more than the
combined total of building a BST (only performed once) and ùíè searches in the BST.
10. Plot a cumulative distribution function (CDF) curve based on the song durations of the
10,000 songs.
